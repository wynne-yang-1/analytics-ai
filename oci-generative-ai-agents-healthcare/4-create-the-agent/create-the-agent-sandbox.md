# Create the Agent

## Introduction

In this lab we are going to create the intelligent agent which will drive our entire solution. We will provide the agent with the required tools and knowledge bases to perform it's work effectively. Tools are resources the agent can use to perform it's tasks. In our use-case, we are going to use two tools:

- **RAG Tool** - Which will scan the clinical policy manuals uploaded to object storage whenever the user requires such information.
- **SQL Tool** - Which will be able to retrieve information stored in our ADB instance relating to the healthcare authorization system.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create our agent including the RAG & SQL Tools and assign the relevant knowledge base to each.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- All previous labs successfully completed.

## Task 1: Create the agent

1. Click the navigation menu on the top left.
1. Click **Analytics & AI**.
1. Click **Generative AI Agents**.

   ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the agents service](./images/navigate-to-agents.png)

1. In the overview page, click the **Agents** link
1. Under the **List scope** section, make sure that your compartment is selected.
1. Click the **Create Agent** button at the top of the **Agents** table.

   ![Screenshot showing how to create a new agent](./images/create-new-agent.png)

1. For the **Name** field use: _healthcare authorization agent_
1. For the **Compartment** field, make sure that your compartment is selected.
1. For the **Description** field, use: _This agent assists healthcare authorization specialists in reviewing authorization requests, evaluating policy compliance, and providing recommendations._
1. For the **Welcome message** field, use: _Hello! I'm your healthcare authorization assistant. How can I help?_
1. Click the **Next** button.

## Task 2: Add the RAG Tool

1. Under the **Tools** section, click the **Add tool** button to create our first tool.

   ![Screenshot showing how to create a new tool](./images/create-new-tool.png)

1. Select the **RAG** tool option.
1. Under the **RAG Configuration** section, use _Knowledge base clinical policy articles_ in the **Name** field.
1. For the **Description** field, use: _Retrieves clinical policy manuals including prior authorization requirements, MRI criteria, specialty medication guidelines, emergency authorization procedures, and clinical coverage standards_.

   It is very important to provide a high-level description of the knowledge that this tool can retrieve. This allows the agent to make accurate decisions when choosing to invoke this tool.

   ![Screenshot showing the initial configuration for the RAG tool](./images/rag-tool-info-1.png)

1. Under the **Add knowledge bases** section, make sure that your compartment is selected in the **Compartment** field.
1. Click the **Create knowledge base** button. In this step we are going to create a knowledge base which references the storage bucket into which we've uploaded the clinical policy manuals.

   ![Screenshot showing more configuration for the RAG tool](./images/rag-tool-info-2.png)

1. In the **New knowledge base** form, use: _Healthcare authorization specialist knowledge base clinical policy articles_ for the **Name** field.
1. Make sure that your compartment is selected in the **Compartment** field.
1. In the **Data store type** field, we will select **Object storage** to be able to retrieve information from our storage bucket.
1. Make sure that **Enable hybrid search** is checked. Enabling this option instructs the system to combine lexical and semantic search when scanning our documents.
1. Click the **Specify data source** button.

   ![Screenshot showing the knowledge base configuration](./images/knowledge-base-info-1.png)

1. In the **Specify data source** form, use: _clinical policy docs_ for the **Name** field.
1. Make sure that the **Enable multi-modal parsing** option is **not** checked. This option enable parsing of rich content, such as charts and graphics, to allow responses based on visual elements. However, we do not have any images in our policy documents so right now this option is not required.
1. Under the **Data bucket** option, select the _clinical-policy-manuals_ bucket into which we've previously uploaded the clinical policy PDF files.
1. Check the **Select all in bucket option**. This option will automatically flag all of the file in the bucket for ingestion instead of us having to select each file individually.
1. Click the **Create** button.

   ![Screenshot showing the data source configuration](./images/data-source-info.png)

1. Back in the **New knowledge base** panel, the **clinical policy docs** data source was added to the **Data source** table.
1. Make sure that the **Automatically start ingestion job for above data sources** option is checked. This will create an ingestion job which will scan all of our files automatically when the knowledge base is initially created. Please note that this will only run the ingestion job once. In order to re-ingest information from the bucket in the future, you will need to trigger a job manually.
1. Click the **Create** button.

   ![Screenshot showing the knowledge base configuration](./images/knowledge-base-info-2.png)

1. The knowledge base will take a few minutes to create and ingest the data.
1. Back at the **Add knowledge bases** panel, make sure that the checkbox next to the knowledge base name is checked.
   >💡 _If your knowledge base does not appear ("No items found"), you can still continue to the next step. The knowledge base is already selected and provisioning in the background. You may open a new tab and navigate to Agents > Knowledge Bases to confirm it is provisioning._

1. Click the **Add tool** button.

   ![Screenshot showing the end of the RAG tool configuration](./images/rag-tool-info-3.png)

## Task 3: Add the SQL Tool

1. Now that we have our RAG tool configured, let's configure our SQL tool. In the **Tools** section Click the **Add tool** button.

   ![Screenshot showing the create tool button for creating the SQL tool](./images/create-new-tool.png)

1. Click the **SQL** option.
1. For the **Name** field, use: _Healthcare authorization database_.
1. For the **Description** field, use: _Tables contain patients, authorization requests, statuses, and specialists for healthcare authorization review._.

   ![Screenshot showing the initial set of the SQL tool configuration](./images/sql-tool-info-1.png)

1. Under **Import database schema configuration for this tool**, select the **Inline** option which will allow us to use the same schema text we've used when we created the database.
1. Copy the following text and paste it into the **Database schema** field:

      ```sql
      <copy>
      CREATE TABLE Patients (
      PatientID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
      ExternalPatientID VARCHAR2(20) UNIQUE,
      FirstName VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
